# üìä HR-Attrition-Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive **Human Resources (HR) data analysis and Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** developed in Excel. The core objective is to identify and analyze the critical factors driving **employee attrition** (turnover) within the organization.

The dashboard transforms raw employee data into actionable insights, providing management with a clear, visual tool to understand, predict, and mitigate potential turnover risks.

The final dashboard and supporting analysis provide metrics and visualizations across several key dimensions:

* **Attrition Rate:** Calculates the overall turnover rate and shows trends over time.
* **Demographic Analysis:** Explores attrition rates across different **Age Groups, Gender, and Education** levels.
* **Job Role Breakdown:** Visualizes turnover based on **Job Role** (e.g., Manager, Analyst) and **Department** (e.g., Sales, HR, Finance).
* **Salary vs. Attrition:** Compares average salary for employees who stayed versus those who left (Attrited).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Methodology

This project utilizes advanced Excel features to deliver a robust and interactive analysis:

* **Raw Data Source:** The project begins with a raw dataset containing employee records with various attributes (Salary, Joining Date, Performance, etc.).
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Utilized Excel techniques (formulas, filtering, new columns) to clean the data, handle dates, and categorize attributes (e.g., creating the 'Age Group' field).
* **Pivot Tables & Slicers:** The entire analysis is powered by multiple **Pivot Tables** used to cross-reference data and quickly aggregate metrics. **Slicers** provide the interactive filtering capability for the end-user.
* **Data Visualization:** Custom charts (bar charts, gauges, trend lines) are used to visualize the KPIs on a single, easy-to-read dashboard sheet.
